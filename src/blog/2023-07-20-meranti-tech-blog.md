To celebrate our first year of activity (yes, we incorporated exactly a year ago!), we're excited to announce the launch of our new technical blog.

As a dedicated software consulting company, we specialize in crafting bespoke **Web3** solutions for our esteemed clients. Often, due to the nature of our work, we find ourselves unable to publicly discuss the intriguing projects we are involved in. Nevertheless, throughout this process, we accumulate a wealth of knowledge that profoundly benefits not only our clients but also the larger community.

Indeed, with this blog, we hope to create a network of like-minded individuals, companies, clients or partners, both in France and abroad and continue building on the valuable insights and experiences we gain during our journey of pushing the boundaries in decentralized technology.
