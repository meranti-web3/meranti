In this 2nd part on how to create an FA2 compatible SBT on Tezos, we're going to bring our custom implementation 100% on par with the ERC721 one.
To accomplish this, we'll add token and contract metadata, as well as the minting and burning behaviors.

1. Token metadata
2. Contract metadata
3. Mint and Burn

4. part 3: additional features (creation date), custom view methods
